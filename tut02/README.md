Summary:
The Principles of Shaping emphasize finding the right balance between abstraction and specificity when defining a project's scope. On one end of the spectrum, being too concrete, such as immediately diving into wireframes and high-fidelity mockups, stifles creativity and can lead to estimation errors. Over-specifying the design limits the team's ability to reconsider decisions and adapt to unforeseen complexities. Conversely, being too abstract by defining projects in a few vague words can create confusion and leave team members without enough information to make informed decisions. Under-specified projects can also grow out of control without clear boundaries. A case study illustrates how shaping should involve rough, but well-thought-out solutions that provide direction, boundaries, and a clear understanding of what's in and what's out.

Shaping work possesses several key properties: it is rough, implying that it is unfinished and open to interpretation; it is solved, meaning that the main elements of the solution are outlined even if fine details are not specified; and it is bounded, indicating the project's limits and the allocated time. Shaping requires a combination of design, technical literacy, and strategic thinking. It's a creative and integrative process that can be done individually or collaboratively behind closed doors. Shaping and building work are kept on separate tracks, with shapers working on future potential projects while teams focus on building what has already been shaped. Shaping follows four main steps: setting boundaries, roughing out the elements, addressing risks and potential obstacles, and finally, writing a pitch to present the shaped project for consideration by the team.
