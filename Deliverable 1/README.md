Overview
 
Hotel-Palace is a comprehensive hotel-management program designed to facilitate and manage the operation of a chain of hotel branches. The program serves multiple purposes, both for hotel personnel and visitors, to enhance the overall experience of booking rooms at a variety of hotels across North America. The purpose of the application is to stand as a tool that benefits both corporations and guests by serving as a central hub for ultimate and efficient service.

Problem 
Currently there is no interface by which users may browse, access, and manage bookings. This presents a problem for the organization as they are fundamentally a business and require clients.

Appetite
There are currently only 4-5 developers available to create a viable product to help resolve this problem. Thus a minimally functioning website which allows users to browse different available rooms and schedule a stay is desirable.  
 
Time budget
6 weeks
 
Solution
Having a website for a hotel booking business is immensely beneficial as it provides a centralized, easily accessible platform for travelers to explore and book accommodations. A well-designed website showcases a hotel's features, amenities, and room options. It enables potential guests to compare prices, read reviews, and view images, thereby making informed decisions.
